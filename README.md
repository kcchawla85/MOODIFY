# MOODIFY: Emotion Detection Web Application
Moodify is a web application that can detect the emotions of a person by analyzing their text input. It uses a deep learning model to analyze text features and predict the corresponding emotion. The application provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to input a text and receive a prediction of the emotion.

# Features:
1. Input Text: The user can input any text they want to analyze for emotional content. The text can be entered manually or copied and pasted from another source.
2. Emotion Detection: Once the text has been entered, the application uses NLP algorithms to analyze the content and detect the underlying emotional tone. The application can detect a wide range of emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and more.
3. Emotion Score: After analyzing the text, the application provides a score for each detected emotion, indicating the strength or intensity of that emotion in the text.
4. Visualization: The application also provides a visual representation of the emotional content, using colors or graphs to show the relative strength of each detected emotion.
5. Real-Time Results: The user can analyze the real time emotions of the person using the web

# Limitations:
1. The application is designed to analyze text only, and may not be able to accurately detect emotions in other types of content, such as images or videos.
2. The accuracy of the emotion detection may be influenced by factors such as the quality of the text input, the complexity of the language used, and cultural differences in the interpretation of emotions.
